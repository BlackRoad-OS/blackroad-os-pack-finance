## 💡 Best Practices

1. **Consistency**: Use the same emoji for the same concept across all docs
2. **Clarity**: Don't overload - 2-3 emojis max per line
3. **Context First**: Lead with context emoji, then action/status
4. **Machine-Readable**: Stick to the 127 canonical set
5. **Visual Hierarchy**: Use emojis to create scannable structure

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Use in Templates**: All templates now use this emoji system
2. **Train AI**: Claude/ChatGPT can learn these patterns
3. **Consistency**: All docs follow same emoji language
4. **Evolution**: Propose new emojis via PR with justification

**Remember**: These 127 emojis are on payroll. Use them consistently. 🧠💿🚀
